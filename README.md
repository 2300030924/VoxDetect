This project implements a simplified Target Speaker Diarization and ASR System using modular components.
The system can:

✔ Extract a target speaker’s voice from a mixed conversation
✔ Perform Voice Activity Detection (VAD)
✔ Run Whisper ASR on each segment
✔ Restore punctuation
✔ Generate structured diarization JSON output
✔ Save target speaker audio
